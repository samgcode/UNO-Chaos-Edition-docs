# UNO: Chaos edition
## Abstract
UNO: Chaos edition, is an UNO ruleset created with the goal of creating as much chaos as possible while straying as minimally from the base of UNO as possible. This ruleset is playable with a normal deck of UNO cards, however the main rules and also some additional rules are defined for use with an UNO: Flip deck. These rules are also partially inspired by a project called the "UNO amalgam" created by ( #todo-uno insert link). The amalgam ruleset differs quite drastically however because it aims to combine all official versions of UNO, whereas this seeks to make an easily accessible game with the purpose of causing shenanigans. 
## Disclaimer
These rules were not created with any idea of competitive fairness or frankly any control whatsoever from the players over whether they win or lose. The idea is to mess with your friends and have a good laugh. Expect to be screwed over by both the games and your pals at almost every possible moment.
## Quick start
Now with that said, since this documentation is very long, here's the fastest way to get started:
- If you wanna see if any recent changes have been made, check [the change log](https://github.com/samgcode/UNO-Chaos-Edition-docs/commits/main)
- If you want to just jump into the chaos ruleset, [this page](./docs/rule-sets/rule-sets.html#Chaos) has a brief summary of all the necessary modifications from basic UNO, as well as links to pages explaining each mechanic more in depth. 
- The list of all relevant card effects and links to more explanation about them can be found [here] 
- Similar summaries for other rulesets such as [basic uno](./docs/rule-sets/rule-sets.html#Basic%20uno), and [the one you know isn't official but you play it anyway because its fun](./docs/rule-sets/rule-sets.html#Standard%20rules), can be found in [Rule sets](./docs/rule-sets/rule-sets.html). 
- The page [Card tables](./docs/rule-sets/card-tables.html) has a list for each rule set of what cards are considered [power cards](./docs/base-rules/), and links to relevant information about each.

and that's about all you need to know to get started! If you want to read further in depth about any mechanic see the [index](#Index) below. If you have any suggestions, issues, or think something needs more clarification, you can submit a [github issue here](https://github.com/samgcode/UNO-Chaos-Edition-docs/issues), but first check to see that no one has made an issue about that already. If there is a n existing issue feel free to leave a comment on it! Within the docs, wherever there is a ***\#todo-uno*** tag, that means I plan on doing whatever it is that the tag says, but haven't gotten around to it yet. Thanks for reading, and have fun with the chaos that follows :)
